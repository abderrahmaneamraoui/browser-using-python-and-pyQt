Building a web browser from scratch using Python and Qt involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) and integrating a web rendering engine. In this example, we'll use PyQt5 for the GUI and integrate QtWebEngine for the web rendering part. Make sure you have PyQt5 and QtWebEngine installed. You can install them using pip:
1-pip install PyQt5
2-pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
